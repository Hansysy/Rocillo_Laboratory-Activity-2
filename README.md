# Rocillo_Laboratory-Activity-2

# Project overview 
- In this project, we implemented CRUD API through Postman, it is shown here that in order to do all of those commands/actions we need to have folders and files thatt is connected to the database so that we can extract or add data to it (e.g. controllers, routes, and config). We first learn how to do it with a step by step guide that is in our UST Portal through our Course by our Professor. At the end, after we have done those, we are tasked to create another database and to do CRUD in that database.


# Setup steps and How to Run
Step 1: Open Apache and MySQL in XAMPP.

Step 2: Creating the Database "students" and username from phpMyAdmin that is needed.

Step 3: Open MS Studio in order to run codes and terminals.

Step 4: Initializing the Project by running commands such as npm init -y, npm install express mysql2 dotenv, npm install -D nodemon

Steps 5:Creating other files and folders needed such as the Controllers, Routes, and Config.

Step 6: Configuring the environment and connecting it to the database. 

Step 7: Running to show if executed properly by NPM run dev

Step 8: Defining the logic of the Controller and determining the routes in order to execute CRUD.

Step 9: Implementing CRUD through POSTMAN, setting up the environment that has the value of the localhost that is connected to the database.

STEP 10: Checking the health first if running properly then; trying POST, GET, GET by ID, and DELETE.

STEP 11: Doing all of the steps once again but with a new database called courses.

STEP 12: Push all of the files into this Repisotory.
